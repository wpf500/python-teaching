1) Variables, functions (parameters, outputs)

basic variables
n = 2
name = 'blah'
print 'Hello' + name

1.5) Testing conditions
get_field(row, field)

can we find out more information about this row?
control statements -> if statements
e.g. was strike in Raqqa?
l1 = get_row_location(row)
l2 = get_city_location('Raqqa')
etc.

1.6) Create function wrap above steps

2) What about testing all rows?
First: lists
rows = get_rows()
rows[0], lists are 0 indexed

for loops

3) What can you do in Excel?
Count all occurrences of one, maybe two combinations?
How about all possible combinations?

basic aggregation: initialise count to 0, increment on condition == True

4) advanced aggregation
4.1) a dictionary? places[place] += 1, group by place effectively

4.2) how about two lists,
4.3) how about a dictionary of lists
